    <h4>
      Poker is a game that relies upon continuous education, reflection, and
      improvement. For players that play live poker, keeping track of their
      statistics can prove challenging. The mission of this project is to
      provide users with the ability to track the results of their live poker
      sessions from the convenience of their mobile device. The Poker Trax
      application [see Diagram 1] will allow users to enter in the location,
      duration, buy-in (money risked), and cash-out (money gained/lost) of the
      poker games they attend. The application will then use this information to
      show the users their hourly win/loss rate, overall profits, and understand
      what environments and scenarios they not only thrive in, but also struggle
      in.
